# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project is designed to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. The notebook `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` contains a step-by-step implementation, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Additionally, a Streamlit app is provided for an interactive user interface to classify news articles.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Performance evaluation with metrics
- Streamlit app for real-time fake news detection

## How to Use
1. Open `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Run each cell sequentially to process the data, train the model, and evaluate results.
4. To launch the Streamlit app:
   - Replace the Ngrok token in the script with your own.
   - Run the script to start the app.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Fake News Detection** dataset from Kaggle: [Fake News Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainpooja/fake-news-detection). Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the correct directory or update the path accordingly in the notebook.

## Streamlit App Interface
